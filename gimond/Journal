This is a journal that will contain the evolution of the project.

This folder will contain Ganglia's internal monitoring daemon for the GSoC 2014
project.

At first this daemon will be coded outside of the existing project with a main,
but then it'll be modified to fit into a thread that can be launched when it
needs to be.


The deadlines are as follow, and what was done will be filled in as the project
gets into shape:


May:

19th - 25th: Reading code and browsing libraries.
	- The daemon will be based on the existing libraries found in
/monitor-core/libmetrics so that it can evolve with these libraries if they
change. This will allow the same portability as the rest of Ganglia.


26th - 1st: Defining which metrics should be sent/asked for and defining proper
protocols and queries.
	- The daemon will be based around a TCP server that receives and answers
requests, the protocols and queries it will follow and answer will be defined
in due time.



June:

2nd - 8th: Making use cases and coding a simple TCP server that accepts requests
and, for the time being answers them by echoing the request followed random JSON
data.


9th - 15th: Looking for the correct way to get the stats and the libraries
needed for them.


15th - 29th: Adding these to the server's answers.


30th - 6th: Checking for bugs and simplifying code.



July:

7th - 13th: Setting up a simple web page to show the data.


14th - 20th: "Connecting" the web page to the server and showing stats in text
form.


21st - 27th: Text is replaced with graphics.


28th - 3rd: Checking for bugs and simplifying code.



Aug:

4th - 18th: Padding and doing man pages, adding proper comments in the code,
etc.
